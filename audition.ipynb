    "Networks are a paramount tool in the data scientist toolbox. Their most famous usage is, obviously, the analysis of social network interactions (Facebook, linkedin, twitter, etc.). But networks are also widely used in other domains such as telecomunication, logistics, fraud detection (network of fraudsters), biostatistics (genetics, genomics) or recommendation engines. Using network can also be a great way to visualize interactions in 2D. Here, we propose to study how to create and display network using a Marvel hero interaction dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we assume the student to have basics in python. We will start by loading and manipulating the dataset using pandas. Then, we will transition to network analysis. The student is going to create a network using the networkx package. Then he/she will learn how to display such network in a jupyter notebook. Finally, we will dive into the common network measures such as degree, centrality, betweeness,... and derive insights on the Marvel universe.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset the student will use is the Marvel social network dataset. It is freely available on the internet (typically on Kaggle as the [hero-network.csv](https://www.kaggle.com/csanhueza/the-marvel-universe-social-network#hero-network.csv)). It contains two columns: \"id1\" and \"id2\". Each line represent two heroes appearing in the same comic. This is a great dataset to learn about network analysis. First, it's big enough not to be a toy dataset. Second, because it contains real insights about how the Marvel universe is structured. Finally, it is also quite similar to a real social network, having internal clusters and a long tail distribution. To get a feeling of what we will cover, have a look at the [original blog post](https://blog.dataiku.com/2015/05/19/marvel-social-graph-analysis).  "
